# Always-on rules — NovelTracker

## Start of every session — check permissions

At the start of every conversation or when resuming work, read
`.kilo/kilo.json` to understand what permissions you have. Do not ask
permission for actions that are already set to "allow" in kilo.json.

## Continuity — any session must be able to continue

Durable files, not the chat, are the source of truth. Chat history is **not**
shared between sessions or VS Code windows, so another agent may resume with
zero memory of this conversation.

- **Start of every session/task:** `AGENTS.md` is auto-loaded; its
  **"Current status"** section is the single source of truth for the stage and
  the next action.
- **Stage agents** (analyst, critic, architect, test-author, implementer):
  update only your stage's status (print `[STATUS]` line). Do NOT update
  `AGENTS.md` or `README.md` — the orchestrator or user does that once at the
  end of the flow.
- **Orchestrator or manual flow end:** update `AGENTS.md` "Current status"
  section (stage table + next action) once after the full flow or when genuinely
  blocked. Append to `README.md` progress log only for decisions/reversals, not
  routine progress.
- **Never leave a decision, blocker, convention, or next step only in chat.**
  If it matters to continuing the work, write it to a durable file.
- Keep `AGENTS.md`'s "Current status" short and unambiguous: a fresh agent with no
  history must be able to resume from it alone.

## Documentation sync — start of every task

Before doing anything else, check that `AGENTS.md` ("Current status"), the specs,
and the README still match reality, and update them first when needed:

- `AGENTS.md` "Current status" — pipeline stage table + the exact next action.
- `AGENTS.md` — update when the project's stack, structure, conventions, or
  domain mapping change.
- `README.md` — the progress log is a **decisions log**, not a changelog: record
  the *why* (decisions, reversals, conventions); git already tracks the *what*.

## Origin: PAM (provenance only)

This project's spec-driven, multi-agent workflow is **derived from** PAM
(`PAM/`), but PAM is an **enterprise NestJS / Turborepo / TypeScript** codebase
and NovelTracker is a **plain-JS / Express / raw-SQL** project. PAM is therefore
a **historical reference, not a pattern to copy**:

- Do **not** consult `PAM/` during normal feature work — its conventions do not
  apply to this stack.
- Consult it only when the user explicitly asks about the workflow's origin.
- Never introduce PAM machinery (or any new file) without proposing it — with the
  exact text — and getting approval first.

## Spec-driven workflow — user provides requirements

The workflow for analysing feature specifications:

1. **User provides feature description** — The user describes features in plain
   language in the chat dialogue. The agent does NOT invent or create feature
   descriptions.
2. **Agent may ask questions** — The agent can ask clarifying questions or
   suggest improvements if requirements are unclear or incomplete.
3. **spec-analyst converts to Gherkin** — Once requirements are clear, the
   spec-analyst agent converts them into executable Gherkin scenarios in
   `spec/features/<domain>/<feature-slug>.feature`.
4. **User reviews and approves** — The user reviews the generated spec file
   before it becomes frozen. Once frozen, changes go only through spec-analyst
   in revise mode.

### Two documentation layers (both come from the user)

The user's plain-language input is the single source for BOTH documents; the
difference is form and timing, not origin:

- **`spec/domains/<domain>/requirements.md`** — the canonical, numbered list of
  rules (`REQ-001`, `REQ-002`, …) in EARS form ("When …, the system must …").
  Written down once per domain and kept stable; it is the source of truth for
  business rules. Each rule is one sentence plus a short "Why it matters" line —
  **no acceptance criteria**: the concrete cases, boundaries, and error paths
  live in the `.feature` scenarios (one rule maps to one or more scenarios).
- **`spec/features/<domain>/<feature-slug>.feature`** — executable Gherkin
  examples of those rules. Many examples may prove one rule. Each scenario
  carries `@req:<domain>#REQ-nnn` pointing back at the rule it proves.

Flow: user describes → the analyst writes/updates the numbered requirements →
the analyst writes Gherkin examples that trace to those numbers → the user
reviews and freezes the `.feature`. Requirements are never invented by the
agent; they are the user's intent recorded in canonical form.

## Automatic driver ("foreman" / orchestrator) — SUSPENDED

The `spec-orchestrator` agent and the `/spec-flow` command are **suspended as of
2026-10-27**: parked in `.kilo/suspended-agents/` and therefore **not
registered** — Kilo only discovers `.kilo/agent/*.md` and `.kilo/command/*.md`.
The user wants to run everything **manually for now**, one stage at a time, so
the workflow is exactly: run each stage with its own command (`/spec-analyse`,
`/spec-critique`, `/spec-design`, `/spec-test`, `/spec-implement`), review the
output, then run the next.

Do **not** propose reactivating the orchestrator or recreate `/spec-flow`
unless the user asks. To reactivate, move `.kilo/suspended-agents/spec-orchestrator.md`
back to `.kilo/agent/` and `.kilo/suspended-agents/spec-flow.md` back to
`.kilo/command/`. Stages 6 (review) and 7 (document) are not created yet, so the
chain stops after implementation.

## Live rules — update them as we talk

Rules are not static. During any interaction, watch for anything that should
change how we work and propose a rule update:

- A new convention, decision, or constraint the user states → propose adding
  or amending a rule in `.kilo/rules/core.md`.
- A recurring correction or an instruction the agent keeps getting wrong →
  propose a rule so it sticks for future sessions.
- A rule that no longer matches how we actually work → propose removing or
  rewriting it.

The agent always proposes the change (showing the exact text) and applies it
only after the user approves. Rules live in `.kilo/rules/` (always-on) and
`.kilo/agent/` (per-agent); permission settings live in `.kilo/kilo.json`.

## Design inputs — docs and wireframes

External design material is an input to the spec-driven loop, never the
behavioral source of truth:

- **Written requirements / specification documents** are analyse-stage inputs.
  The user provides them (or places them under `spec/domains/<domain>/`) and
  the spec-analyst converts them into `.feature` scenarios. The frozen
  `.feature` remains the source of truth.
- **UI designs and wireframes** (e.g. Figma, low-fidelity sketches) are
  implementation inputs for the `app/client/` UI and may inform the wording of
  UI-facing scenarios. When kept in-repo they live under
  `spec/domains/<domain>/ui/`. Visual layout is never the behavioral source of
  truth — the Gherkin scenarios are.

Never treat a design document or wireframe as a requirement that overrides a
frozen `.feature`: when they disagree, the `.feature` wins until it is revised
through the spec-analyst.

## Done means documented

A task is not complete until `AGENTS.md`'s "Current status" and the README
progress log are up to date. Judge "needs update?" once before starting the task
and again before declaring it done. In particular, the "Next action" in
`AGENTS.md` must always reflect the true next step for whoever resumes.
